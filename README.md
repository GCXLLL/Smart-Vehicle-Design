# Smart Vehicle Design

## Introduction

This project is designed for finishing the course Team Design Project and Skills (TDPS) in Glasgow College, UESTC. Detailed instructions of concrete tasks are shown in Design Tasks.pdf. I have uploaded the code of all the software parts, including Openmv and Stem32.

## Framework

Since TDPS is a group work, we divided the work into 10 part:

- Robot framework construction and power supply arrangement
- Motor driving circuit applying
- Printed Circuit Board (PCB) designing
- Precise Rotation Support
- Distance Measurement
- Central control
- Line Recognition
- Shape recognition
- Wireless communication 
- Robotic Manipulator 

The figure below shows the basic relationship and dependence between different sections in our vehicle.

To integrate different sections in a vehicle, we designed the sketch of our vehicle as below
